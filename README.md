# Breast Cancer Classification

This repository contains code and resources for a breast cancer classification project. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Winston dataset, a well-known dataset widely used in breast cancer research. It contains a collection of features extracted from breast mass images, along with their corresponding labels indicating whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SeaBorn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/cyblogerz/Breast-cancer-classification.git
```
2. Change into the project directory:
```
cd breast-cancer-classification
```
3. Run the `breast_cancer_classification.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to see the implementation and results of the breast cancer classification model.
